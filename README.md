# CryptoClustering

For this assignment, the goal was to use Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. The K-Means algorithm is implemented both with and without Principal Component Analysis to cluster the data.

## To Run:
Python needs to be installed. The Jupyter notebook can either be ran cell-by-cell or as a whole.
